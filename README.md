# Bamazon

This command line node program is meant to simulate a customer shopping at a store. When the program loads the user can see the name, id, department, and quantity associated with each product available. Then they can select a product by ID and choose the amount of the product they want. 

Once they do that, the program will check to make sure their is a sufficent stock of the product requested and if so it will log to console that the product was added to cart, the total cost of the transaction, then that the inventory (database) was updated. 

If the program determines their is insufficient stock it will let the user know then in either case the user is prompted back to the main inventory menu where they can select another product to purchase or purchase the same product again but adjust the amount requested appropriately.
